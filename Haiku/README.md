# Scratch Project Documentation
- I created three different threads in Scratch
- I created one thread that acted as a loop/cycle, when my ghost sprite is click, that starts off with the same sounds for my sprite but different text for every different cycle
- I created another thread that when interacted with allows my sprite to think a thought as well as move (steps) with each click
- I created another thread that changes the pitch of the space ripple when the space bar is pressed and I created a similar thread for my other sprite that performs a similar action
- Some issues that I ran into were with the pitch change, I wasn't sure how to reserve the pitch after it reached a higher frequency, it wasn't an issue for me, just something I had observed  
- I did use some of the sprite examples as a reference such as the variable one, and the loop one
