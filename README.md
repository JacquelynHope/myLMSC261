# H1 Let's begin
⋅⋅* A computer works as a clock with benefits
⋅⋅* A computer follows instructions. Different items are computers or will be at some point and not in the most obvious way
⋅⋅* Although computers do have limits
## H2 2.1 How Do You Type an "A"
⋅⋅* hitting keys on your computer keyboard sends a scancode
⋅⋅* as the keyboard waits to be pressed the computer waits to receive a signal from the keyboard
⋅⋅* in order for a computer to display an "a" on a screen it has to take the image of the "a" out of its memory, "as part of a font, an "a" is made up of lines and circles"
⋅⋅* these lines and circles are then rendered into a small box of pixels that are stored in the part of the computer's memory that manages the screen
### H3 2.2 From Hardware To Software
⋅⋅* In this day and age, hardware comes with software, just as a PC comes with an operating system
⋅⋅* The systems coders built after the 1980s is used to manage global economic infrastructure
⋅⋅* "software is everywhere"(Tyrangiel)
#### H4 2.3 How Does Code Become Software
⋅⋅* Coding can emerge from a "sequence of symbols"(Tyrangiel)
⋅⋅* Code is inert as it deals with running software that transforms the code into machine language
⋅⋅* code is converted into an "explicit list of instructions that can be carried out by interconnected logic gates"(Tyrangiel)
⋅⋅* a complier is known as a software that takes symbols you type into a file and then transform them into lower-level instructions
⋅⋅* every character is important!
##### H5 2.4 What Is an Algorithm?
⋅⋅* An algorithm works to solve issues
⋅⋅* a programming language is an algorithm management system
⋅⋅* "An Algorithm can be translated into a function, and that function can be called (run) when software is executed"(Tyrangiel)
###### H6 2.5 The Sprint
⋅⋅* wireframe mock-ups are pictures of how a website would look, made a program that creates sketched looking visuals
####### H7 2.6 What's With All These Conferences Anyway?
⋅⋅* "People come together in the dozens or thousands and attend panels, ostensibly to learn; they attend presentations and brush up their skills, but there’s a secondary conference function, one of acculturation." (Tyrangiel)
⋅⋅* there has been a lot of sexual harassment and sexist content in these conferences
⋅⋅* "Conferences began to develop codes of conduct, rules and algorithms for people (men, really) to follow."(Tyrangiel)
⋅⋅* Large Tech Companies are just now starting to fund diversity initiatives
⋅⋅* This field, these jobs in tech are male-dominated
