# H1 Let's begin
1. A computer works as a clock with benefits
2.  A computer follows instructions. Different items are computers or will be at some point and not in the most obvious way
3. Although computers do have limits
## H2 2.1 How Do You Type an "A"
1.  hitting keys on your computer keyboard sends a scancode
2. as the keyboard waits to be pressed the computer waits to receive a signal from the keyboard
3.  in order for a computer to display an "a" on a screen it has to take the image of the "a" out of its memory, "as part of a font, an "a" is made up of lines and circles"
4.  these lines and circles are then rendered into a small box of pixels that are stored in the part of the computer's memory that manages the screen
### H3 2.2 From Hardware To Software
1. In this day and age, hardware comes with software, just as a PC comes with an operating system
2.  The systems coders built after the 1980s is used to manage global economic infrastructure
3. "software is everywhere"(Tyrangiel)
#### H4 2.3 How Does Code Become Software
1. Coding can emerge from a "sequence of symbols"(Tyrangiel)
2. Code is inert as it deals with running software that transforms the code into machine language
3.  code is converted into an "explicit list of instructions that can be carried out by interconnected logic gates"(Tyrangiel)
4.  a complier is known as a software that takes symbols you type into a file and then transform them into lower-level instructions
5.  every character is important!
##### H5 2.4 What Is an Algorithm?
1.  An algorithm works to solve issues
2. a programming language is an algorithm management system
3.  "An Algorithm can be translated into a function, and that function can be called (run) when software is executed"(Tyrangiel)
###### H6 2.5 The Sprint
1. wireframe mock-ups are pictures of how a website would look, made a program that creates sketched looking visuals
####### H7 2.6 What's With All These Conferences Anyway?
1.  "People come together in the dozens or thousands and attend panels, ostensibly to learn; they attend presentations and brush up their skills, but thereâ€™s a secondary conference function, one of acculturation." (Tyrangiel)
2.  there has been a lot of sexual harassment and sexist content in these conferences
3.  "Conferences began to develop codes of conduct, rules and algorithms for people (men, really) to follow."(Tyrangiel)
4.  Large Tech Companies are just now starting to fund diversity initiatives
5.  This field, these jobs in tech are male-dominated
