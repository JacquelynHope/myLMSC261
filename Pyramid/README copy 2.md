# Assignment-pyramid
- I realized from this assignment that I don't believe I have a good understanding of the concepts we're learning in class, I went to and learned code about how to create the pyramid but was confused on how to make stack and have stack answer questions and respond to my messages
- In conclusion, I will be going to tutoring after this because I don't feel like I really understand everything that I'm doing with these most recent projects/homework
