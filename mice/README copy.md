# Assignment-mice
- This assignment did not go very well for me, I thought I was off to a great start although it ended up really being a challenge and I didn't get it this time around
- I thought I understood based on the new information I learned during the most recent class session but maybe I misunderstood
- Was unsure how to get that exact spacing and three separate lines with one single print function
- Hoping I will get clarity on this with today's upcoming class session
